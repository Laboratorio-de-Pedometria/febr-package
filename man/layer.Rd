\arguments{
\item{data.set}{Character vector indicating the identification code of one or more data sets.
Use \code{data.set = "all"} to download all data sets.}

\item{variable}{(optional) Character vector indicating one or more variables. Accepts only
general identification codes, e.g. \code{"ferro"} and \code{"carbono"}. If missing, then a set of standard
identification variables is downloaded. Use \code{variable = "all"} to download all variables. See
\sQuote{Details} for more information.}

\item{stack}{(optional) Logical value indicating if tables from different datasets should be
stacked on a single table for output. Requires \code{standardization = list(units = TRUE)} -- see
below. Defaults to \code{stack = FALSE}, the output being a list of tables.}

\item{missing}{(optional) List with named sub-arguments indicating what should be done with a
layer missing data on sampling depth, \code{depth}, or data on variable(s), \code{data}. Options are
\code{"keep"} (default) and \code{"drop"}.}

\item{standardization}{(optional) List with named sub-arguments indicating how to perform data
#' standardization.
\itemize{
\item \code{plus.sign} Character string indicating what should be done with the plus sign (\code{+})
commonly used along with the inferior limit of the bottom layer of an observation. Options are
\code{"keep"} (default), \code{"add"}, and \code{"remove"}.

\item \code{plus.depth} Numeric value indicating the depth increment (in centimeters) when processing
the plus sign (\code{+}) with \code{plus.sign = "add"}. Defaults to \code{plus.depth = 2.5}.

\item \code{lessthan.sign} Character string indicating what should be done with the less-than sign
(\code{<}) used to indicate that the value of a variable is below the lower limit of detection.
Options are \code{"keep"} (default), \code{"subtract"}, and \code{"remove"}.

\item \code{lessthan.frac} Numeric value between 0 and 1 (a fraction) by which the lower limit of
detection should be subtracted when \code{lessthan.sign = "subtract"}. Defaults to
\code{lessthan.frac = 0.5}, i.e. subtract 50\\% from the lower limit of detection.

\item \code{repetition} Character string indicating what should be done with repetitions, i.e.
repeated measurements of layers in an observation. Options are \code{"keep"} (default) and
\code{"combine"}. In the latter case, it is recommended to set \code{lessthan.sign = "subtract"} or
\code{lessthan.sign = "remove"}.

\item \code{combine.fun} Character string indicating the function that should be used to combine
repeated measurements of layers in an observation when \code{repetition = "combine"}. Options are
\code{"mean"} (default), \code{"min"}, \code{"max"}, and \code{"median"}.

\item \code{transition} Character string indicating what should be done about the wavy and irregular
transition between subsequent layers in an observation. Options are \code{"keep"} (default) and
\code{"smooth"}.

\item \code{smoothing.fun} Character string indicating the function that should be used to smooth wavy
and irregular transitions between subsequent layers in an observation when
\code{transition = "smooth"}. Options are \code{"mean"} (default), \code{"min"}, \code{"max"}, and \code{"median"}.

\item \code{units} Logical value indicating if the measurement unit(s) of the continuous variable(s)
should be converted to the standard measurement unit(s). Defaults to \code{units = FALSE}, i.e. no
conversion is performed. See \code{\link[=dictionary]{dictionary()}} for more information.

\item \code{round} Logical value indicating if the values of the continuous variable(s) should be
rounded to the standard number of decimal places. Requires \code{units = TRUE}. Defaults to
\code{round = FALSE}, i.e. no rounding is performed. See \code{\link[=dictionary]{dictionary()}} for more information.
}}

\item{harmonization}{(optional) List with named sub-arguments indicating if and how to perform
data harmonization.
\itemize{
\item \code{harmonize} Logical value indicating if data should be harmonized. Defaults to
\code{harmonize = FALSE}, i.e. no harmonization is performed.

\item \code{level} Integer value indicating the number of levels of the identification code of the
variable(s) that should be considered for harmonization. Defaults to \code{level = 2}. See
\sQuote{Details} for more information.
}}

\item{progress}{(optional) Logical value indicating if a download progress bar should be displayed.}

\item{verbose}{(optional) Logical value indicating if informative messages should be displayed. Generally
useful to identify datasets with inconsistent data. Please report to \email{febr-forum@googlegroups.com}
if you find any issue.}

\item{febr.repo}{(optional) Defaults to the remote file directory of the Federal University of
Technology - ParanÃ¡ at \url{https://cloud.utfpr.edu.br/index.php/s/Df6dhfzYJ1DDeso}.
Alternatively, a local directory path can be informed if the user has a local copy of the data
repository.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} of \code{data.frame}s or a \code{data.frame} with, possibly standardize or harmonized,
data of the chosen variable(s) of the chosen dataset(s).
}
\description{
Download data from the 'layer' ("camada") table of one or more datasets published in
the \href{https://www.pedometria.org/febr/}{Data Repository of the Brazilian Soil}. This
table includes data such as sampling depth, horizon designation, and variables such as pH, carbon
and clay content, and much more.
}
\details{
\subsection{Default variables}{
Default variables (fields) present in the 'layer' table are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{dataset_id}. Identification of the dataset in FEBR to which an observation belongs.
\item \code{evento_id_febr}. Identification code of an observation in a dataset.
\item \code{camada_id}. Sequential layer number, from top to bottom.
\item \code{camada_altid}. Layer designation according to some standard description guide.
\item \code{amostra_id}. Laboratory number of a sample.
\item \code{profund_sup}. Upper boundary of a layer (cm).
\item \code{profund_inf}. Lower boundary of a layer (cm).
}
Further details about the content of the default variables (fields) can be found in
\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bqo8HtitZv11TXzTviVq2bI5dE6_t_fJt0HE-l3IMqM}
(in Portuguese).
}
\subsection{Harmonization}{
Data harmonization consists of converting the values of a variable determined using some method
\emph{B} so that they are (approximately) equivalent to the values that would have been obtained if
the standard method \emph{A} had been used instead. For example, converting carbon content values
obtained using a wet digestion method to the standard dry combustion method is data
harmonization.

A heuristic data harmonization procedure is implemented in the \strong{febr} package. It consists of
grouping variables based on a chosen number of levels of their identification code. For example,
consider a variable with an identification code composed of four levels, \code{aaa_bbb_ccc_ddd}, where
\code{aaa} is the first level and \code{ddd} is the fourth level. Now consider a related variable,
\code{aaa_bbb_eee_fff}. If the harmonization is to consider all four coding levels (\code{level = 4}),
then these two variables will remain coded as separate variables. But if \code{level = 2}, then both
variables will be re-coded as \code{aaa_bbb}, thus becoming the same variable.
